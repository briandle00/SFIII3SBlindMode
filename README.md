# SFIII3SBlindMode
A blind accessibility mode for the classic 2D fighter Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike.

Created for the Liquid Hacks 2020 hackathon by Phi-Long Bui, Kevin Dai, Brian Le, and Riley Okumura.

## History and Inspiration
Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike is one of the most influential fighting games of all time. It still stands up today against modern games, and was the game behind the well-known Evo Moment 37.

Games today often utilize stereo sound for immersion, but why not take sound further and provide information to the vision impaired? With inspiration from 
novriltataki, we have created a prototype of this idea using FBNeo, the main emulator used for netplay by today's 3rd Strike community.

Some central ideas from the video include:

> "While fighting games have many useful sounds that indicate what is going on, **most of the information is presented visually.** By **converting the visual information to audio,** blind players will be able to grasp what's going on a lot better."

> If we apply the **Pareto Principle** to solve this problem, we can assume that **20% of visual info holds 80% of overall importance,** and the other 80% of visual info only adds 20% importance. Based on our knowledge of fighting games, we think that this crucial 20% is **the position of your character on the screen in relation to the opponent.**
